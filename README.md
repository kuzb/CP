- Bitwise Operations
  - Check Subset sum
      you are given N numbers. Check if there is a subset of them, with the sum qual to
      target value S.

- Bitsets
  - There are `N <= 5000` workers. Each is available during some days of this month.
      Find two workers with maximum intersection of their schedules.

- Binary Search
  - Find the first number that is equal or greater than the target in a sorted list.
  - Find the smallest number in shifted sorted list, like [3,4,5,6,7,1,2].
  - Find the maximum number in a list that increases and then decreases, like [1,3,5,7,8,6,4,2]
  - Find the square root of an number to some precision.
